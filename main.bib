	abstract = {Proton MRS (1 H MRS) provides noninvasive, quantitative metabolite profiles of tissue and has been shown to aid the clinical management of several brain diseases. Although most modern clinical MR scanners support MRS capabilities, routine use is largely restricted to specialized centers with good access to MR research support. Widespread adoption has been slow for several reasons, and technical challenges toward obtaining reliable good-quality results have been identified as a contributing factor. Considerable progress has been made by the research community to address many of these challenges, and in this paper a consensus is presented on deficiencies in widely available MRS methodology and validated improvements that are currently in routine use at several clinical research institutions. In particular, the localization error for the PRESS localization sequence was found to be unacceptably high at 3 T, and use of the semi-adiabatic localization by adiabatic selective refocusing sequence is a recommended solution. Incorporation of simulated metabolite basis sets into analysis routines is recommended for reliably capturing the full spectral detail available from short TE acquisitions. In addition, the importance of achieving a highly homogenous static magnetic field (B0 ) in the acquisition region is emphasized, and the limitations of current methods and hardware are discussed. Most recommendations require only software improvements, greatly enhancing the capabilities of clinical MRS on existing hardware. Implementation of these recommendations should strengthen current clinical applications and advance progress toward developing and validating new MRS biomarkers for clinical use.},

	doi = {10.1002/mrm.28385},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Accurate baseline modeling is essential for reliable MRS analysis and interpretation-particularly at short echo-times, where enhanced metabolite information coincides with elevated baseline interference. The degree of baseline smoothness is a key analysis parameter for metabolite estimation, and in this study, a new method is presented to estimate its optimal value.
METHODS: An adaptive baseline fitting algorithm (ABfit) is described, incorporating a spline basis into a frequency-domain analysis model, with a penalty parameter to enforce baseline smoothness. A series of candidate analyses are performed over a range of smoothness penalties, as part of a 4-stage algorithm, and the Akaike information criterion is used to estimate the appropriate penalty. ABfit is applied to a set of simulated spectra with differing baseline features and experimentally acquired 2D MRSI-both at a field strength of 3 Tesla.
RESULTS: Simulated analyses demonstrate metabolite errors result from 2 main sources: bias from an inflexible baseline (underfitting) and increased variance from an overly flexible baseline (overfitting). In the case of an ideal flat baseline, ABfit is shown to correctly estimate a highly rigid baseline, and for more realistic spectra a reasonable compromise between bias and variance is found. Analysis of experimentally acquired data demonstrates good agreement with known correlations between metabolite ratios and the contributing volumes of gray and white matter tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: ABfit has been shown to perform accurate baseline estimation and is suitable for fully automated routine MRS analysis.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Subject motion and static field (B0 ) drift are known to reduce the quality of single voxel MR spectroscopy data due to incoherent averaging. Retrospective correction has previously been shown to improve data quality by adjusting the phase and frequency offset of each average to match a reference spectrum. In this work, a new method (RATS) is developed to be tolerant to large frequency shifts ({\textgreater}7 Hz) and baseline instability resulting from inconsistent water suppression.
METHODS: In contrast to previous approaches, the variable-projection method and baseline fitting is incorporated into the correction procedure to improve robustness to fluctuating baseline signals and optimization instability. RATS is compared to an alternative method, based on time-domain spectral registration (TDSR), using simulated data to model frequency, phase, and baseline instability. In addition, a J-difference edited glutathione in-vivo dataset is processed using both approaches and compared.
RESULTS: RATS offers improved accuracy and stability for large frequency shifts and unstable baselines. Reduced subtraction artifacts are demonstrated for glutathione edited MRS when using RATS, compared with uncorrected or TDSR corrected spectra.
CONCLUSIONS: The RATS algorithm has been shown to provide accurate retrospective correction of SVS MRS data in the presence of large frequency shifts and baseline instability. The method is rapid, generic and therefore readily incorporated into MRS processing pipelines to improve lineshape, SNR, and aid quality assessment.},

	doi = {10.1002/nbm.4702},
	abstract = {Edited MRS sequences are widely used for studying gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the human brain. Several algorithms are available for modelling these data, deriving metabolite concentration estimates through peak fitting or a linear combination of basis spectra. The present study compares seven such algorithms, using data obtained in a large multisite study. GABA-edited (GABA+, TE = 68 ms MEGA-PRESS) data from 222 subjects at 20 sites were processed via a standardised pipeline, before modelling with FSL-MRS, Gannet, AMARES, QUEST, LCModel, Osprey and Tarquin, using standardised vendor-specific basis sets (for GE, Philips and Siemens) where appropriate. After referencing metabolite estimates (to water or creatine), systematic differences in scale were observed between datasets acquired on different vendors' hardware, presenting across algorithms. Scale differences across algorithms were also observed. Using the correlation between metabolite estimates and voxel tissue fraction as a benchmark, most algorithms were found to be similarly effective in detecting differences in GABA+. An interclass correlation across all algorithms showed single-rater consistency for GABA+ estimates of around 0.38, indicating moderate agreement. Upon inclusion of a basis set component explicitly modelling the macromolecule signal underlying the observed 3.0 ppm GABA peaks, single-rater consistency improved to 0.44. Correlation between discrete pairs of algorithms varied, and was concerningly weak in some cases. Our findings highlight the need for consensus on appropriate modelling parameters across different algorithms, and for detailed reporting of the parameters adopted in individual studies to ensure reproducibility and meaningful comparison of outcomes between different studies.},

	doi = {10.1002/mrm.29418},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Multiple data formats in the MRS community currently hinder data sharing and integration. NIfTI-MRS is proposed as a standard spectroscopy data format, implemented as an extension to the Neuroimaging informatics technology initiative (NIfTI) format. This standardized format can facilitate data sharing and algorithm development as well as ease integration of MRS analysis alongside other imaging modalities.
METHODS: A file format using the NIfTI header extension framework incorporates essential spectroscopic metadata and additional encoding dimensions. A detailed description of the specification is provided. An open-source command-line conversion program is implemented to convert single-voxel and spectroscopic imaging data to NIfTI-MRS. Visualization of data in NIfTI-MRS is provided by development of a dedicated plugin for FSLeyes, the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) image viewer.
RESULTS: Online documentation and 10 example datasets in the proposed format are provided. Code examples of NIfTI-MRS readers are implemented in common programming languages. Conversion software, spec2nii, currently converts 14 formats where data is stored in image-space to NIfTI-MRS, including Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and vendor proprietary formats.
CONCLUSION: NIfTI-MRS aims to solve issues arising from multiple data formats being used in the MRS community. Through a single conversion point, processing and analysis of MRS data are simplified, thereby lowering the barrier to use of MRS. Furthermore, it can serve as the basis for open data sharing, collaboration, and interoperability of analysis programs. Greater standardization and harmonization become possible. By aligning with the dominant format in neuroimaging, NIfTI-MRS enables the use of mature tools present in the imaging community, demonstrated in this work by using a dedicated imaging tool, FSLeyes, for visualization.},

	abstract = {Advances in magnetic resonance imaging have shown how individual differences in the structure and function of the human brain relate to health and cognition. The relationship between individual differences and the levels of neuro-metabolites, however, remains largely unexplored – despite the potential for the discovery of novel behavioural and disease phenotypes. In this study, we measured 14 metabolite levels, normalised as ratios to total-creatine, with 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) acquired from the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices of six healthy participants, repeatedly over a period of four months. ANOVA tests revealed statistically significant differences of 3 metabolites and 3 commonly used combinations (total-choline, glutamate + glutamine and total-N-acetylaspartate) between the participants, with scyllo-inositol (F=85, p=6e-26) and total-choline (F=39, p=1e-17) having the greatest discriminatory power. This was not attributable to structural differences. When predicting individuals from the repeated MRS measurements, a leave-one-out classification accuracy of 88\% was achieved using a support vector machine based on scyllo-inositol and total-choline levels. Accuracy increased to 98\% with the addition of total-N-acetylaspartate and myo-inositol – demonstrating the efficacy of combining MRS with machine learning and metabolomic methodology. These results provide evidence for the existence of neuro-metabolic phenotypes, which may be non-invasively measured using widely available 3 Tesla MRS. Establishing these phenotypes in a larger cohort and investigating their connection to brain health and function presents an important area for future study.},

	abstract = {MRS can provide high accuracy in the diagnosis of childhood brain tumours when combined with machine learning. A feature selection method such as principal component analysis is commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of metabolite profiles prior to classification. However, an alternative approach of identifying the optimal set of metabolites has not been fully evaluated, possibly due to the challenges of defining this for a multi-class problem. This study aims to investigate metabolite selection from in vivo MRS for childhood brain tumour classification. Multi-site 1.5 T and 3 T cohorts of patients with a brain tumour and histological diagnosis of ependymoma, medulloblastoma and pilocytic astrocytoma were retrospectively evaluated. Dimensionality reduction was undertaken by selecting metabolite concentrations through multi-class receiver operating characteristics and compared with principal component analysis. Classification accuracy was determined through leave-one-out and k-fold cross-validation. Metabolites identified as crucial in tumour classification include myo-inositol (P {\textless} 0.05, AUC=0.81±0.01 ), total lipids and macromolecules at 0.9 ppm (P {\textless} 0.05, AUC=0.78±0.01 ) and total creatine (P {\textless} 0.05, AUC=0.77±0.01 ) for the 1.5 T cohort, and glycine (P {\textless} 0.05, AUC=0.79±0.01 ), total N-acetylaspartate (P {\textless} 0.05, AUC=0.79±0.01 ) and total choline (P {\textless} 0.05, AUC=0.75±0.01 ) for the 3 T cohort. Compared with the principal components, the selected metabolites were able to provide significantly improved discrimination between the tumours through most classifiers (P {\textless} 0.05). The highest balanced classification accuracy determined through leave-one-out cross-validation was 85\% for 1.5 T 1 H-MRS through support vector machine and 75\% for 3 T 1 H-MRS through linear discriminant analysis after oversampling the minority.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Heating of gradient coils and passive shim components is a common cause of instability in the B0 field, especially when gradient intensive sequences are used. The aim of the study was to set a benchmark for typical drift encountered during MR spectroscopy (MRS) to assess the need for real-time field-frequency locking on MRI scanners by comparing field drift data from a large number of sites.
METHOD: A standardized protocol was developed for 80 participating sites using 99 3T MR scanners from 3 major vendors. Phantom water signals were acquired before and after an EPI sequence. The protocol consisted of: minimal preparatory imaging; a short pre-fMRI PRESS; a ten-minute fMRI acquisition; and a long post-fMRI PRESS acquisition. Both pre- and post-fMRI PRESS were non-water suppressed. Real-time frequency stabilization/adjustment was switched off when appropriate. Sixty scanners repeated the protocol for a second dataset. In addition, a three-hour post-fMRI MRS acquisition was performed at one site to observe change of gradient temperature and drift rate. Spectral analysis was performed using MATLAB. Frequency drift in pre-fMRI PRESS data were compared with the first 5:20 minutes and the full 30:00 minutes of data after fMRI. Median (interquartile range) drifts were measured and showed in violin plot. Paired t-tests were performed to compare frequency drift pre- and post-fMRI. A simulated in vivo spectrum was generated using FID-A to visualize the effect of the observed frequency drifts. The simulated spectrum was convolved with the frequency trace for the most extreme cases. Impacts of frequency drifts on NAA and GABA were also simulated as a function of linear drift. Data from the repeated protocol were compared with the corresponding first dataset using Pearson's and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).
RESULTS: Of the data collected from 99 scanners, 4 were excluded due to various reasons. Thus, data from 95 scanners were ultimately analyzed. For the first 5:20 min (64 transients), median (interquartile range) drift was 0.44 (1.29) Hz before fMRI and 0.83 (1.29) Hz after. This increased to 3.15 (4.02) Hz for the full 30 min (360 transients) run. Average drift rates were 0.29 Hz/min before fMRI and 0.43 Hz/min after. Paired t-tests indicated that drift increased after fMRI, as expected (p {\textless} 0.05). Simulated spectra convolved with the frequency drift showed that the intensity of the NAA singlet was reduced by up to 26\%, 44 \% and 18\% for GE, Philips and Siemens scanners after fMRI, respectively. ICCs indicated good agreement between datasets acquired on separate days. The single site long acquisition showed drift rate was reduced to 0.03 Hz/min approximately three hours after fMRI.
DISCUSSION: This study analyzed frequency drift data from 95 3T MRI scanners. Median levels of drift were relatively low (5-min average under 1 Hz), but the most extreme cases suffered from higher levels of drift. The extent of drift varied across scanners which both linear and nonlinear drifts were observed.},

	abstract = {In vivo quantification of glutamate (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) using MRS is often achieved using two separate sequences: a short-echo point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) acquisition for Glu and a Mescher-Garwood PRESS (MEGA-PRESS) acquisition for GABA. The purpose of this study was to examine the agreement of Glu and Glx (the combined signal of glutamate + glutamine) quantified from two different GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS acquisitions (GABA plus macromolecules, GABA+, TE = 68 ms, and macromolecule suppressed, MMSup, TE = 80 ms) with Glu and Glx quantified from a short-echo PRESS (PRESS-35, TE = 35 ms) acquisition. Fifteen healthy male volunteers underwent a single scan session, in which data were acquired using the three acquisitions (GABA+, MMSup and PRESS-35) in both the sensorimotor and anterior cingulate cortices using a voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3 cm3 . Glx and Glu were quantified from the MEGA-PRESS data using both the OFF sub-spectra and the difference (DIFF) spectra. Agreement was assessed using correlation analyses, Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients. Glx quantified from the OFF sub-spectra from both the GABA+ and MMSup acquisitions showed poor agreement with PRESS-35 in both brain regions. In the sensorimotor cortex, Glu quantified from the OFF sub-spectra of GABA+ showed moderate agreement with PRESS-35 data, but this finding was not replicated in the anterior cingulate cortex. Glx and Glu quantified using the DIFF spectra of either MEGA-PRESS sequence were in poor agreement with the PRESS-35 data in both brain regions. In conclusion, Glx and Glu measured from MEGA-PRESS data generally showed poor agreement with Glx and Glu measured using PRESS-35.},

	abstract = {Background

1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) facilitates noninvasive diagnosis of pediatric brain tumors by providing metabolite profiles. Prospective studies of diagnostic accuracy and comparisons with conventional MRI are lacking. We aimed to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of MRS for childhood brain tumors and determine added clinical value compared with conventional MRI.

Methods
Children presenting to a tertiary pediatric center with brain lesions from December 2015 through 2017 were included. MRI and single-voxel MRS were acquired on 52 tumors and sequentially interpreted by 3 radiologists, blinded to histopathology. Proportions of correct diagnoses and interrater agreement at each stage were compared. Cases were reviewed to determine added value of qualitative radiological review of MRS through increased certainty of correct diagnosis, reduced number of differentials, or diagnosis following spectroscopist evaluation. Final diagnosis was agreed by the tumor board at study end.

Results
Radiologists’ principal MRI diagnosis was correct in 69\%, increasing to 77\% with MRS. MRI + MRS resulted in significantly more additional correct diagnoses than MRI alone (P = .035). There was a significant increase in interrater agreement when correct with MRS (P = .046). Added value following radiologist interpretation of MRS occurred in 73\% of cases, increasing to 83\% with additional spectroscopist review. First histopathological diagnosis was available a median of 9.5 days following imaging, with 25\% of all patients managed without conclusive histopathology.

Conclusions
MRS can improve the accuracy of noninvasive diagnosis of pediatric brain tumors and add value in the diagnostic pathway. Incorporation into practice has the potential to facilitate early diagnosis, guide treatment planning, and improve patient care.},

	abstract = {Anodal cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is known to enhance motor learning, and therefore, has been suggested to hold promise as a therapeutic intervention. However, the neural mechanisms underpinning the effects of cerebellar tDCS are currently unknown. We investigated the neural changes associated with cerebellar tDCS using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 34 healthy participants were divided into two groups which received either concurrent anodal or sham cerebellar tDCS during a visuomotor adaptation task. The anodal group underwent an additional session involving MRS in which the main inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters: GABA and glutamate (Glu) were measured pre-, during, and post anodal cerebellar tDCS, but without the behavioural task. We found no significant group-level changes in GABA or glutamate during- or post-tDCS compared to pre-tDCS levels, however, there was large degree of variability across participants. Although cerebellar tDCS did not affect visuomotor adaptation, surprisingly cerebellar tDCS increased motor memory retention with this being strongly correlated with a decrease in cerebellar glutamate levels during tDCS across participants. This work provides novel insights regarding the neural mechanisms which may underlie cerebellar tDCS, but also reveals limitations in the ability to produce robust effects across participants and between studies.},
